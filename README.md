This is a great project loved doing it. It is amazing to see the kinds of things JavaScript is able to do. 

Challenges
I so not get the logic of Javascript. Its ont hing to have a code and find lines that expalin what they do and what is the function of each line, but if its just a sentence and im the one who has to figure out what is needed i get stuck. I have not been able to find the logic. Its really frustrating but maybe im too impatient because it still new to me. With time it will make more sense as i keep doing it because i remember the same feeling with CSS in the beginning but now its a lot easier to do now that i have been at it for a while now.
